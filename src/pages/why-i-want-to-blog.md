There are many reasons why I want to do give blogging a go. They are:

- Blogging is the greatest conversational tool ever invented
- Learning in public
- Improving my writing
- Establishing a digital platform
- Creating rather than consuming
- Providing accountability

Lets unpack these reasons.

## Blogging is the greatest conversational tool ever invented

Did that get your attention? Bold statement is bold. I was recently digging through Kyle Matthews blog and came across this statement in one of his first posts.

> The blog is the greatest conversational tool ever invented because seconds after I click publish for this post, it can be read across the world by thousands.

Granted that a foundation componenent of a conversation is the fact its between two people.

## Learning in public

I recently read [Show Your Work by Austin Kleon](https://amzn.to/2tse1yR)

## Establishing my own digital presence

I think its pretty cool

See other peoples spaces online

I like to think of

## Demonstrating skills

Resumes suck. Writing them and reading them. What better to show off your skills and experience then pouring everything . Is it riskier have a site/blog over a resume? Probably. But is the potential reward/payoff greater? Definitiely.

## Improving my writing

Being able write well is a critical skill for just about every profession

## Creating over consuming

I'm guilty of

## Provide acountability

Not much annoys me. But a website or blog where the last post was from 3 years agos instantally turns me away 🤷‍♂️

Motivation and discipline

So there you have many reasons why I blog. What about yourself? Drop me a line and let me know. Maybe I've inspired you to do you own thing too?
