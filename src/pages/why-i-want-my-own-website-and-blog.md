Personal websites and blogs can be a powerful platform and communication tool. They provide insight into who you are as a person, and showcase all your awesome projects and ideas. There are many reasons why I want my own website and blog:

- Blogging is the greatest conversational tool ever invented
- Establishing my own digital space
- Create rather than just consume
- Improving communication
- Demonstrating skills and experience

Let's unpack these reasons.

## Blogging is the greatest conversational tool ever invented

Did that get your attention? It's a bold statement, and it grabbed my attention when I was reading through the creator of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), Kyle Matthews' [blog](https://www.bricolage.io/). He writes in one of his [posts](https://www.bricolage.io/first-post/):

> "The blog is the greatest conversational tool ever invented because seconds after I click publish for this post, it can be read across the world by thousands."

At the push a button (actually a git commit - thanks [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)), my thoughts, ideas, and work can be shared across the web and read by anyone with an internet connection. Sure, there's countless other websites and blogs out there to get lost in, but this one is mine.

Also worth noting that the definition of a conversation is the exchange of information between **two** or more people. So if you want to have a chat about anything I write or the projects I'm working on, hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/micahthobbs) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/micahthobbs/).

## Establishing own digital space

It's always been cool seeing other people with their own personal website and online brand. I recently finished reading [Show Your Work by Austin Kleon](https://amzn.to/2tse1yR) which provided the catalyst for finally building my website and sharing my experiences through blog posts. In [Show Your Work](https://amzn.to/2tse1yR), Kleon explores the idea of self-discovery by openly sharing ones work, and process, on the internet. I highly recommend giving it a read.

Personal websites and blogs are pieces of digital real estate that can continually be refined, improved, to create value. Anyone can have their own Medium or DEV profile. Don't get me wrong, these platforms are great and have their place. But the extra effort it takes to create your own space makes it that extra bit special. And hey, it will also be yours.

As Kleon says:

> "The beauty of owning your own turf is that you can do whatever you want with it. Your domain name is your domain. You don’t have to make compromises. Build a good domain name, keep it clean, and eventually it will be its own currency. Whether people show up or they don’t, you’re out there, doing your thing, ready whenever they are."

## Create rather than just consume

There's always going to be another book, article, course, podcast, or YouTube video that I want to consume. And gathering this information is important to personal growth. Productivity and book nerd [Mike Schmitz](http://mikeschmitz.me/) likens it to collecting dots in his [post](http://mikeschmitz.me/how-i-take-notes-on-books-i-read/) on reading books and taking notes:

> "Over time, I believe the benefit of collecting these ideas has had a compound positive affect in my life. I’m amazed as the results sometimes as my brain synthesizes things and connects dots in new ways. But from another angle, maybe I shouldn’t be. Creativity is a formula – the more quality dots you collect, the better the result will be when your brain connects them in new and interesting ways."

But truth be told, I'm guilty of using the collection of dots as a form of procrastination. Continual consuming more information isn't the only step in ones personal development. If it was, everyone would be smart, fit, rich, and happy. It's all good to continue collecting the dots. but, I need to remember to take the next step and use the information to creating things of my own and and develop my craft.

## Improving communication

Two skills that can help anyone's career (and life) no matter the profession, are being able to write and speak well. Being able to effectively communicate thoughts and ideas by clearly articulating them to others is key to achieving just about any goal.

What better way to improve the writing half of the equation than by, well, writing blog posts.

## Demonstrating skills and experience

Resumes suck. Both writing them and reading them. Even the best resumes of the most skilful and experienced person can be a snooze. They seem so forced and artificial.

There is no better way to naturally show off who you really are along with all your skills and experience than by curating them into a living, breathing space online. Personally, I'd rather explore someone's website, discover and interact with projects they have created, and read their blog posts to see what they have been up to.

Is it riskier to have a personal site and blog over a resume? Maybe.

Does it take more effort? No doubt.

Is the potential reward greater? Definitely.
